In addition to skills and tools, teammates have a number of other built in capabilities

### Email

Every teammate has a unique email address that you can send email to and they will determine the best course of action. By setting up a teammate's `Handbook`, you can give them instructions on how to handle common scenarios.

<Note>
Teammates only respond to emails sent by active users in your account. They are not publically accessible to anyone.
</Note>

### Chat

You can chat with your teammates in the Chat interface in the app. They know about their own abilities, their colleagues, their assignment history, and how to use the Teammates app. 

Chatting your teammates is a great way to get started!
