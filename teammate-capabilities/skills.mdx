Teammates are designed to be helpful with a wide variety of tasks, so they have a large catalog of skills and abilities.

<Note>
For best results, only give your teammates the skills that are relevant to their typical tasks. If they have too many capabilities, it increases the chance of them making unintended decisions.
</Note>


### Intrinsic Abilities
- **Format Date And Time:** Translate human-readable dates and times to UTC in ISO8601 format
- **Imagine:** Ideate or imagine a new creative concept. Useful for brainstorming or generating new ideas.
- **Lookup Runbook:** Look in our company runbook to determine how to handle a particular scenario if you're not sure how to proceed. Note that not every scenario will have a specific answer in the runbook.
- **Memorize:** Retain information for later use. Optionally pass metadata that can be associated with the information.
- **Reason:** Ask a large language model (LLM) to reason about a topic. Useful for making if-else branching decisions and managing flow control in a workplan, or extracing meaning from content.
- **Recall:** Recall or remember details previously encountered. May return a status of 'Memory not found' if no relevant memory was found.
- **Use Tool:** Use an external API to accomplish a task.

### Flow Control
- **Clarify:** Ask for clarification about an ambiguous task. Note: If you can make a reasonable guess for what to do, always prefer that - you are designed to be helpful, not to bother people! But if an incorrect assumption or hallucination could have problematic consequences, it is better to ask.
- **Delegate Task:** Delegate a task to another teammate
- **For Each:** Perform a simple or complex task on a collection of items or an array of data
- **Loop:** Process a collection of items. Pass in the list of items and the task to execute on each.

### Document Management

### Online Research
- **Ask AI:** Query a large language AI model to answer open-ended questions or respond to an arbitrary prompt.
- **HTTP Request:** Make an HTTP request to a URL and return the response
- **Research:** Research a topic online. Returns a specific answer, not search results.
- **Web Search:** Search the web for a given query and return the results.
