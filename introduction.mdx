Create virtual AI teammates that work right alongside you, freeing you to focus on the high-impact work that truly matters. All without writing any code or drag-and-drop workflows.

## Craft Your Dream Team

Building your Teammates is a creative and intuitive process. You'll define each teammate's role, skills, and capabilities, tailoring them to your specific business needs. It's like bringing a highly specialized digital assistant to life, crafted precisely for the tasks you need accomplished. Want a Data Analyst to crunch numbers, a Marketing Manager to craft compelling campaigns, or an Engineering Lead to oversee your tech projects? Simply define the roles, and watch as your Teammates come to life, each equipped with the specific skills their position demands.

‍But why stop at individual roles? Group your Teammates into Squads, each designed to tackle complex, multi-faceted projects. Picture a Virtual General Manager orchestrating a team of specialists, each contributing their unique skills to achieve your business goals.

## Plug into Your Digital Ecosystem

Your Virtual Teammates are ready to dive into your existing digital toolbox. They seamlessly integrate with the software your human team already uses, becoming a natural extension of your workflow. A Virtual Recruiter gains access to your applicant tracking system and email, while a Virtual Engineering Manager interfaces effortlessly with GitHub, JIRA, and Slack.

## Assign tasks with prompts

With your Squad assembled and connected, it's time to put them to work. The beauty of teammates lies in their versatility. Need a weekly sales summary emailed to your executive team? Consider it done. Want to optimize your ad budget for maximum ROI based on daily performance analysis? Your Virtual Marketing Specialist is on it.

‍But that's just the beginning. Teammates shine in their ability to react to real-world events. A new sale closes, a job application lands in your inbox, or a crucial piece of code is committed – your Squad springs into action, handling each event with precision and speed.
