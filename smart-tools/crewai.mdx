CrewAI is a popular open source framework that allows you to create and control AI agents with natural language. 

To enable your CrewAI agents to use SaaS products like Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Sheets, and others you can equip them with the `TeammatesSmartTools` tool.


```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

from crewai_tools import (
    TeammatesSmartTools
)

teammates_smart_tools = TeammatesSmartTools()

# Create an agent
project_manager = Agent(
    role='Project Manager',
    goal='Keep the project status on track',
    tools=[teammates_smart_tools]
)

# Give them a task
status_update = Task(
    description='Update the status of task "Forecast the Q3 financials" to "In Progress" in Google Sheets',
    expected_output='The Google Sheet is correctly updated with the new status',
    agent=project_manager
)

# Assemble a crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[project_manager],
    tasks=[status_update] 
)

# Execute the task
crew.kickoff()

```
