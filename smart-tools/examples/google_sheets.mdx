Consider an agent that needs to update the status of an issue in a project planning Google Sheet. Your agent would send the following request:

```json
{
    "tool": "google_sheets",
    "prompt": "Update issue with ID 4 to status 'OK'"
}
```

At this point, your teammate will likely do the following:

1. Introspect the spreadsheet to understand the existing structure, including the column headers, and data types.
2. Search for the issue with ID 4
3. Determine the correct column for the Status
4. Update the status to OK
5. Verify the change was made correctly and the data type & value are valid

#### Why it's interesting

While the prompt seems incredibly simple -- and indeed it would be simple for a human -- it actually requires a number of steps, introspection, and reasoning to correctly accomplish. It can't be done with a single function call.
