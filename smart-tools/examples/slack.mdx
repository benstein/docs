Even something as simple as sending a message to a channel can be complex if the agent needs to ensure the message is formatted correctly with Slack's proprietary Block Kit format and ensure the message is sent to a correct and valid channel.

```json
{
    "tool": "slack",
    "prompt": "Send this message to the channel #general",
    "data": {
        "text": "= Team Update: \n\nHey team! ðŸ‘‹ Just wanted to share a quick update about our progress on the Q3 goals. We're making great strides! ðŸŽ¯ \n\n*Key highlights:*\n- Revenue up 15%\n- Customer satisfaction at 92%\n- New feature launch next week"
    }
}
```



Your teammate will do the following:

1. Validate the channel name is correct
2. Reformat the message to ensure it is formatted correctly with Slack's Block Kit format
3. Send the message to the channel #general

#### Why it's interesting

Slack uses a JSON message format called Block Kit and a proprietary flavor of Markdown called "mrkdwn". Your agents don't need to know any of this, as they can simply send a natural language request and the teammate will handle the formatting. For reference, this is the message that the teammate would eventually send to Slack API:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": {
        "type": "plain_text",
        "text": "Team Update"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "Hey team! ðŸ‘‹ Just wanted to share a quick update about our progress on the Q3 goals. We're making great strides! ðŸŽ¯"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*Key highlights:*\nâ€¢ Revenue up 15%\nâ€¢ Customer satisfaction at 92%\nâ€¢ New feature launch next week"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
