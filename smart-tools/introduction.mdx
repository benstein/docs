## Overview

AI agents are powerful, but they can only do so much "real work." Teammates' SmartTools allows your AI agents -- not just teammates -- to **operate popular SaaS apps with natural language**.

As businesses adopt AI agents to transform their workflows, they expect agents to seamlessly interact with the variety of SaaS platforms powering today’s workplaces. But the reality is, today's agent API integrations – usually called "function calling" or "tool calling" – only allows agents to retrieve or create simple data. 

More sophisticated tasks, like correctly updating records in CRMs or adding complex data to spreadsheets, require a deep understanding of the products and nuanced controls. These SaaS platforms often involve business rules, custom objects, and unique configurations that are often easy for human operators, but agents simply can’t interpret out of the box. **Businesses need their AI agents to not only technically integrate with these systems, but to truly “understand” how to use them.**

SmartTools solves this challenge by providing your AI agents -- not just Teammates' -- with pre-built expertise in navigating and operating popular SaaS applications such as GSuite, Slack, Salesforce, and more. Unlike traditional agent tools that only enable basic transactional actions, SmartTools gives agents the understanding required to carry out sophisticated operations. For example, a simple command to “add a row to the end of a spreadsheet” triggers an agent’s understanding of everything from selecting the correct worksheet to understanding headers, formatting data types, writing formulas, handling duplicate entries, and more.


## How it works

SmartTools provides an API that enables your AI agents to fully operate popular SaaS applications with natural language. 

Your agents provide:
 - **Tool name** e.g. _salesforce_
 - **A description of the action to perform** e.g. _update the Coca-Cola opportunity to 'closed/won'_

Your teammate then gets to work with their SmartTools, interpreting the request, planning the steps required to accomplish the task, and then performing the action(s) in your target application. 

## Key Features

- **Assignment Understanding**: SmartTools uses natural language processing to understand the intent of the request, extract necessary data, and plan the steps required to accomplish the task.
- **Contextual Understanding**: SmartTools takes into account the current state of the application and existing data to make more informed decisions.
- **Verification**: SmartTools don't fire and forget. They verify the results of their actions and take corrective action or notify your agent.
- **Error Handling**: SmartTools includes error handling to catch and recover from common issues, such as network errors or rate limiting.
- **Pagination**: SmartTools can handle pagination to retrieve all results when a request returns multiple pages.
- **Large File/Record Handling**: SmartTools enables you to process large amounts of data, say, 1,000s of records or large documents, that don't fit in a single context window.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: SmartTools can ask for human review or approval before taking high risk actions.
- **Clarification**: Prompts can be ambiguous, so SmartTools will ask for clarification if needed (ideally provided by your agent, not by a human).
- **Framework Integrations**: SmartTools are available out-of-the-box with popular agent frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI.
