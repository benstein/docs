## Overview

**Teammates' SmartTools allows your AI agents to operate popular SaaS apps with natural language**.

As businesses adopt AI agents to transform their workflows, they (reasonably) expect them to operate the variety of SaaS tools powering today’s workplaces. But the reality is, today's agent API integrations – usually called "function calling" or "tool use" – only allow AI agents to retrieve or create simple data. 

Any task that requires more than a single POST -- like updating records in CRMs or adding data to a spreadsheet -- require a deep understanding of the products being used and nuanced controls. These SaaS platforms involve business rules, custom objects, and unique configurations that are often easy for human operators, but agents simply can’t interpret out of the box. SaaS applications just weren't built for agents. 

<Tip>Businesses need agents that don't just integrate with their tools _technically_. They need agents that _understand how to use them_.</Tip>

SmartTools solves this challenge by providing your AI agents with pre-built expertise to operate popular SaaS applications such as GSuite, Microsoft 365, Slack, Salesforce, and more. For example, a simple command to “add a row to the end of a Google Spreadsheet” triggers an agent’s understanding of everything from managing permissions to selecting the correct worksheet to understanding headers, formatting data types, writing formulas, handling duplicate entries, and more, all with a single natural language description.


## How it works

SmartTools provides an API that enables your AI agents to fully operate popular SaaS applications with natural language. 

Your agents provide:
 - **Tool name** e.g. _salesforce_
 - **A description of the action to perform** e.g. _update the Coca-Cola opportunity to 'closed/won'_

We then get to work interpreting the request, planning the steps required to accomplish the task, and performing the action(s) in your target application. 

## Key Features

- **Assignment Understanding**: SmartTools uses natural language processing to understand the intent of the request, extract necessary data, and plan the steps required to accomplish the task.
- **Contextual Understanding**: SmartTools takes into account the current state of the application and existing data to make more informed decisions.
- **Permissioning**: SmartTools supports white label authentication flows for all major SaaS applications, enabling your agents to operate on behalf of your customers without you worrying about credentials.
- **Verification**: SmartTools don't fire and forget. They verify the results of their actions and take corrective action or notify your agent.
- **Error Handling**: SmartTools includes error handling to catch and recover from common issues, such as network errors or rate limiting.
- **Pagination**: SmartTools can handle pagination to retrieve all results when a request returns multiple pages.
- **Large File/Record Handling**: SmartTools enables you to process large amounts of data, say, 1,000s of records or large documents, that don't fit in a single context window.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: SmartTools can ask for human review or approval before taking high risk actions.
- **Clarification**: Prompts can be ambiguous, so SmartTools will ask for clarification if needed (ideally provided by your agent, not by a human).
- **Framework Integrations**: SmartTools are available out-of-the-box with popular agent frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI.
